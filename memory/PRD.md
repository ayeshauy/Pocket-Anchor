# Pocket Anchor - PRD

**Owner:** ayesha.pocketagency@gmail.com
**Started:** Feb 2026
**Stack:** FastAPI · MongoDB · React 19 · Emergent (Google Auth, Universal LLM, Object Storage)

## Problem statement (verbatim)
Pocket Anchor is a warm, non-clinical digital sanctuary structured into three pillars — Sanctuary & Silent Support, Nomadic Health & Medical Infrastructure, and Survivor & IPV Support Services — for travelers and individuals in crisis. Color palette: Cloud, Azul, Mimosa, Orange, Aperol, Willow Grove. Typography: Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans.

## User choices (locked)
- All three pillars at MVP fidelity
- Emergent-managed Google Auth (no passwords)
- Emergent Universal LLM key with **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (streaming SSE)
- Emergent Object Storage for uploads
- Deferred: USDC payments (Financial Anchor), wearables, STD/dental booking

## Personas
- **The Anchor holder** — user in silent struggle; wants passive support, no metrics.
- **The Supporter** — friend/family who lands on `/with/:slug`; leaves a reason to stay.
- **The Traveler** — needs vetted clinics, medical vault, language-aware triage.
- **The Survivor** — needs discreet resources, evidence vault, quick-exit safety.

## Implemented (Feb 2026, iter 1)
- Auth: Emergent Google OAuth, /api/auth/session + /me + /logout, session cookie 7d
- Onboarding: sanctuary name + auto slug + Anchor Link generation
- Sanctuary: Mood Pulse orb (3 states), 14-day chart, Wall of Hope (Felt/Fav), Break Glass Archive, Private Journal (mood + tags), Breathing Player (4-7-8, Box, Wave), Comfort AI (Claude Sonnet 4.6 SSE), 988 SOS
- Anchor public `/with/:slug`: text/photo/voice/song, kindness counter, no login, no receipts
- Nomadic Health: Spatial Health Guide (6 seeded clinics), Medical Vault CRUD, Global Doctor Network cards
- Safety: Public Resource Directory (US/UK/AU/IN/FR), Survivor Navigator AI (Claude Sonnet 4.6), Evidence Vault with decoy mode ("Notes & Recipes"), Rebuilding Tracker (4 tracks)
- Quick Exit: floating button + Esc×2 decoy weather screen (site-wide)
- Object storage: public + private uploads, blob download with auth

## Backlog
- **P0:** Voice recording (in-app) for anchor public + memory vault; Guardian Dashboard invites; email supporter link out
- **P1:** Real map (Leaflet/Mapbox) for Spatial Health Guide; wearable ingest (Apple Health/Google Fit)
- **P2:** USDC/Stripe payments, dental & STD clinic subverticals, memorial archive video import

## Architecture notes
- MongoDB: users, user_sessions, mood_pulses, journal, hope_reasons, evidence, rebuilding, medical, files, ai_messages
- Object storage prefix: `pocket-anchor/{public|private}/{user_id}/{uuid}.{ext}`
- SSE headers: `X-Accel-Buffering: no` to defeat proxy buffering
- Session cookie: httpOnly, secure, samesite=none
